# Capital Commitment Tracker

**Campaign:** Venture Capital Fund III, L.P.  
**Goal:** $10,000,000 USD
<br>
![Capital Commitments Thermometers](./thermometer.svg?v=20251120225039-19553838804-1)

## What this shows
- **10 mini thermometers** side by side, each representing **$1,000,000** of the $10M goal.
- **Solid red fill** grows upward as capital commitments increase.
- **Bulb:** white at $0; turns **red** once the segment > $0.
- **Tube:** white background, light gray outline.
- **Ticks:** Major every **$100k**, minor every **$50k**.
- Tracks **capital commitments** (not cash collections which come later via capital calls).

## Viewing your index.html page
If you are trying to view your index.html file inside GitHub’s repo UI, GitHub does not render HTML there; it shows the source. To see the page rendered, use one of the options below.

**A) Publish the page via GitHub Pages (recommended)**

In your repo: Settings → Pages

Build and deployment → Source: “Deploy from a branch”

Branch: main • Folder: / (root) • Save

Your site will be at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`

Now your index.html (logo + title + thermometer) will render at that URL.

**B) Show it directly in the README (so it appears on the repo page)**

Add this html to README.md so the logo and chart display on the repo homepage:

![Capital Commitments Thermometers](./thermometer.svg?v=20251120225039-19553838804-1)
```
See the top of this readme.md to confirm usage.

**C) Preview locally**
Just open index.html in your browser (double-click), or run a quick server:

```
bash
python -m http.server 8080
```
then visit http://localhost:8080/

If the page is not displaying properly, you may need to clear your cache.

## Clearing Cache
Sometimes your browser or the CDN caches an older HTML file. Use one of these methods to force a refresh:

**A) Open your GitHub Pages URL (not the repo view):**
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`
(If you use a custom domain, use that instead.)

**B) Add a cache-buster to the page URL:**
Append ?v=now to force a fresh fetch of index.html.
Example: https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/?v=now

**C) Hard refresh the page:**

Windows/Linux: Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R

macOS: Cmd + Shift + R

If images still look stale:
Many sites add a ?v= number to image URLs (e.g., thermometer.svg?v=123…, assets/logo.svg?v=123…).

Check the page source and confirm the image URLs include ?v= so the browser pulls fresh copies.

## Why this works
Adding ?v=now makes the page URL unique, so the browser/CDN won’t reuse a cached HTML response.

If your build also appends ?v= to image URLs, the new HTML will point to new image URLs, which forces fresh images too.

## Finding your GitHub Pages URL
In your repo: Settings → Pages → under GitHub Pages, use the “Visit site” link (or note the listed URL).

Make sure Pages is set to Deploy from a branch and points to the folder where index.html lives (often main / (root)).

## How to update numbers
Edit `data/funds.json` and set the 10 values in `"segments"` (dollars). Example:
```json
{
  "goal": 10000000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "label": "Venture Capital Fund III, L.P.",
  "segments": [1000000, 1000000, 750000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
```
